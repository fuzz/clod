# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: You must NEVER change the agreed-upon technical approach without explicitly consulting me first. If you encounter any challenges:

1. **STOP** and explain the exact issue you're facing in detail
2. Present options with trade-offs for consideration
3. Ask **explicitly** for my decision before proceeding
4. If I have specified a technology, do **not** substitute another technology without asking

Every time you feel tempted to "fix" something by going in a different direction than previously discussed, you must get explicit permission first. Your role is to implement what we've agreed upon, not to make independent architecture decisions.
