## Release Process (Next Steps)

1. Review all changes with project owner
2. Update version and copyright information if needed
3. Create a git tag for version 0.1.0
4. Use `bin/release-to-hackage.sh` to prepare the package
5. Publish to Hackage using the commands provided by the script
6. Update Homebrew formula with actual SHA256 hash after GitHub release
7. Update GitHub repository with release notes

## Notes for Future Enhancement

- Consider using parallelism in FileSystem operations for better performance with large codebases
- Evaluate integrating with cloud storage services
- Consider adding a GUI interface as a separate component
- Improve integration with IDEs and other development tools
