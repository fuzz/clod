# Safety Guardrails for ClaudeCodeSync

This document outlines recommended safety practices when using ClaudeCodeSync. Since different projects have different requirements, we've provided a menu of guardrails that you can implement based on your specific needs.

## API Cost Management

Without proper controls, AI-assisted development can potentially lead to unexpected API costs. Consider implementing these guardrails:

### Token Usage Monitoring
```
# Add to your project instructions
When implementing changes, I should first:
1. Estimate token usage for the planned implementation
2. Inform the user of this estimate before proceeding
3. Get explicit confirmation for implementations likely to use >10K tokens
```

### Session Budgeting
```
# Add to your project instructions
I should track approximate token usage during this session and alert the user when approaching:
- 50% of budget (warning)
- 80% of budget (caution)
- 95% of budget (final warning)

The user's specified token budget for this session is [USER_SPECIFIED_AMOUNT].
```

### Operation Batching
```
# Add to your project instructions
When multiple files require changes, I should:
1. Group related changes into batches
2. Summarize all planned changes before implementation
3. Implement changes in order of dependency to minimize redundant operations
```

## Filesystem Protection

Safeguarding your filesystem during AI-assisted development is critical. Consider these protective measures:

### Safe Directories
```
# Add to your project instructions
I should only write to files within these safe directories:
- [LIST_OF_SAFE_DIRECTORIES]

If a requested change would modify files outside these directories, I must:
1. Alert the user to this fact
2. Require explicit confirmation before proceeding
```

### Automatic Backups
```
# Add to your project instructions
Before modifying any file, I should:
1. Create a backup with the suffix .bak-[TIMESTAMP]
2. Inform the user of the backup location
3. Include instructions for restoring from backup if needed
```

### Version Control Integration
```
# Add to your project instructions
Before implementing changes, I should:
1. Confirm the project directory is under version control
2. Advise the user to commit current changes
3. Suggest creating a branch for experimental changes
```

## Code Quality Safeguards

Maintain code quality during AI-assisted development with these guardrails:

### Test Coverage Requirements
```
# Add to your project instructions
When modifying code, I should:
1. Identify existing tests for the modified functionality
2. Create or update tests to maintain [DESIRED_PERCENTAGE]% test coverage
3. Run tests before marking changes as complete
```

### Static Analysis Integration
```
# Add to your project instructions
After making changes but before finalizing, I should:
1. Recommend running appropriate linters/static analyzers
2. If available, interpret and summarize any linting errors
3. Offer to fix common issues automatically
```

### Documentation Updates
```
# Add to your project instructions
For any substantive code changes, I should:
1. Update associated documentation
2. Add/update comments explaining complex logic
3. Update any affected API documentation
```

## User Education

Help users understand the capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted development:

### Progressive Disclosure
```
# Add to your project instructions
When working with new users, I should:
1. Focus on simple, well-defined tasks initially
2. Explain my reasoning process clearly
3. Suggest more complex operations only after successful simple operations
```

### Capability Boundaries
```
# Add to your project instructions
I should clearly communicate when requests fall outside my capabilities:
1. Code that requires specialized domain knowledge
2. Operations that would violate security boundaries
3. Tasks that would be more efficiently done by the human
```

### Human Review Reminders
```
# Add to your project instructions
After implementing changes, I should:
1. Remind the user to review all changes before deployment
2. Highlight areas that particularly warrant human review
3. Suggest specific validation steps appropriate to the changes
```

## Implementing Guardrails

### For Individual Developers

1. Review this document and select appropriate guardrails
2. Copy relevant guardrail instructions to your project instructions
3. Customize values (e.g., budget limits, safe directories) as needed
4. Include these instructions when uploading to Claude's project knowledge

### For Teams

1. Create a standardized set of guardrails appropriate for your organization
2. Add these to your team's source control as `clod-guardrails.md`
3. Include this file in your ClaudeCodeSync uploads
4. Reference this file in your project instructions

## Best Practices

- Start with more restrictive guardrails and relax them as you gain experience
- Periodically review and update guardrails based on your experiences
- Share effective guardrails with the community by contributing to this document
- Remember that guardrails are guidelines, not absolute protection against all risks

## Contributing

If you develop effective guardrails for specific use cases, please consider contributing them back to the ClaudeCodeSync project so others can benefit from your experience.
